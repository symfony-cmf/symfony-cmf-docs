Contributing
------------

Symfony CMF is an open source, community-driven project. We follow the same
guidelines as core Symfony. If you'd like to contribute, please read the
[Contributing Documentation][1] part of the documentation. If you're submitting a pull
request, please make yourself comfortable with [the documentation format][2].
The [Symfony documentation guide][3] can be helpful for you - just replace the
repository names in the examples.
