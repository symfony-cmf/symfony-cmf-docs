Contributing
------------

Symfony2 CMF is an open source, community-driven project. We follow the same
guidelines as core Symfony2. If you'd like to contribute, please read the
[Contributing Documentation][1] part of the documentation. If you're submitting a pull
request, please make yourself comfortable with [the format][2], follow the
guidelines in the [Creating a Pull Request][3] section and use the [Pull Request
Format][4].

> :warning: **NOTE**
> If you are documenting new features you should base your PR on the
> **dev branch**, *not* the master branch.
