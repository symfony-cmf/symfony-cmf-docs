this affects the next upcoming version, not the current one. if i am not mistaken, the PR needs to go against the dev branch.

indeed, @dbu is correct. But I can cherry pick it easily in that branch, there is no need to create a new PR.

@WouterJ did you ever cherry-pick this? once its moved to dev we can close this. afaik its needed for the MediaBundle 1.2 as we bumped the LiipImagineBundle
