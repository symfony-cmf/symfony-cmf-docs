Installing and configuring Doctrine PHPCR ODM
=============================================
The goal of this tutorial is to install and configure Doctrine PHPCR ODM.
Note that Symfony2.1 (currently master) is required for the CMF to work.

Preconditions
-------------
- php >= 5.3
- libxml version >= 2.7.0 (due to a bug in libxml http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=36501)
- phpunit >= 3.6 (if you want to run the tests)


Installation
------------

Choosing a content repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first thing to decide is what content repository to use. A content repository is essentially
a database that will be responsible for storing all the content you want to persist. It provides
and API that is optimized for the needs of a CMS (tree structures, references, versioning, full
text search etc.). While every content repository can have very different requirements and
performance characteristics, the API is the same for all of them.

Furthermore since the API defines an export/import format, you can always switch to a different
content repository implementation later on.

These are the available choices:

* Jackalope with Jackrabbit (Jackrabbit requires Java, it can persist into the file system, a database etc.)
* Jackalope with Doctrine DBAL (requires an RDBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite)
* Midgard (requires an RDBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite)

Depending on your choice you can omit certain steps in the following documentation.

Download the bundles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Add the following to your ``composer.json`` file::

    "require": {
        ...
        "jackalope/jackalope-jackrabbit": "1.0.*"
        "jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal": "dev-master"
        "midgard/phpcr": "dev-master"
        "doctrine/phpcr-bundle": "1.0.*",
        "doctrine/phpcr-odm": "1.0.*",
    }

Notice: Remember to check if you are using "doctrine/orm": "2.2.*" (Symofony 2.1 default) and switch to "2.3.*" before updating.

And then run::

    php composer.phar update

Register annotations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Add file to annotation registry in ``app/autoload.php`` for the ODM annotations right after the last ``AnnotationRegistry::registerFile`` line::

    // ...
    AnnotationRegistry::registerFile(__DIR__.'/../vendor/doctrine/phpcr-odm/lib/Doctrine/ODM/PHPCR/Mapping/Annotations/DoctrineAnnotations.php');
    // ...
    
Initialize bundles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Next, initialize the bundles in ``app/AppKernel.php`` by adding them to the ``registerBundle`` method::

    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...

            // Doctrine PHPCR
            new Doctrine\Bundle\PHPCRBundle\DoctrinePHPCRBundle(),

        );
        // ...
    }


Configuration
-------------
Next step is to configure the bundles.

Doctrine PHPCR ODM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Basic configuration, add to ``app/config/config.yml``::

    doctrine_phpcr:
        session:
            backend:
                # Jackalope Jackrabbit
                type: jackrabbit
                url: http://localhost:8080/server/
                # Jackalope Doctrine DBAL (make sure to also configure the DoctrineBundle accordingly)
                type: doctrinedbal
                connection: doctrine.dbal.default_connection
                # Midgard
                type: midgard2
                db_type: MySQL
                db_name: midgard2_test
                db_host: "0.0.0.0"
                db_port: 3306
                db_username: ""
                db_password: ""
                db_init: true
                blobdir: /tmp/cmf-blobs
            workspace: default
            username: admin
            password: admin

More information on configuring this bundle can be found `here <https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrinePHPCRBundle#readme>`_.

Setting up the content repository
---------------------------------

Jackalope Jackrabbit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are the steps necessary to install Apache Jackrabbit:

- Make sure you have Java Virtual Machine installed on your box. If not, you can grab one from here: http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
- Download the latest version from the `Jackrabbit Downloads page <http://jackrabbit.apache.org/downloads.html>`_
- Run the server. Go to the folder where you downloaded the .jar file and launch it::

    java -jar jackrabbit-standalone-*.jar

Going to http://localhost:8080/ should now display a Apache Jackrabbit page.

More information about `running a Jackrabbit server <https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope/wiki/Running-a-jackrabbit-server>`_
can be found on the Jackalope wiki.

As we are using Jackalope as our PHPCR implementation we could also chose other storage backends
like relational databases but for this tutorial we're going to use Jackrabbit.

Jackalope Doctrine DBAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to setup the database run the following steps to create the database and setup a default schema::

    app/console doctrine:database:create
    app/console doctrine:phpcr:init:dbal

Midgard
~~~~~~~

TODO

Registering system node types
----------------------------
PHPCR ODM uses a `custom node type <https://github.com/doctrine/phpcr-odm/wiki/Custom-node-type-phpcr%3Amanaged>`_
to track meta information without interfering with your content. There is a command that makes it trivial to
register this type and the phpcr namespace::

    php app/console doctrine:phpcr:register-system-node-types

Creating a new workspace
------------------------

This step is optional since there is always a workspace "default" available::

    app/console doctrine:phpcr:workspace:create my_workspace
