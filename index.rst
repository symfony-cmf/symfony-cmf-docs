Symfony CMF Documentation
=========================

Welcome to the official documentation of the `Symfony Content Management Framework`_.

The Symfony2 Content Management Framework project is organized by the Symfony
community and has several sponsoring companies and prominent open source leaders
implementing the philosophy of the `decoupled CMS`_. You can read learn more about the
project on the `about`_ page.

This documentation is currently in development and far from complete. See `Documentation planning`_
for an overview of the work left to do. Want to help? Thank you, all help greatly appreciated!
The source of the `documentation is hosted on github`_.

Mission Statement
-----------------

    The Symfony CMF project makes it easier for developers to add CMS functionality to
    applications built with the Symfony2 PHP framework. Key development principles for
    the provided set of bundles are scalability, usability, documentation and testing.

Why another CMS?
----------------

Actually we consider this project to be a CMF, a **content management framework**, rather
than a CMS, a content management system. The reason is that we are only **providing tools
to build a custom CMS**. There are obviously many CMS solutions available today already,
but they tend to be tailored first and foremost towards end users and also many tend
to carry a lot of legacy baggage which make them less than **ideal for developing highly
custom applications** like what is possible with `Symfony2`_.

What is our target audience?
----------------------------

There are basically two main target audiences:

#. Developers that have built an existing custom application with Symfony2 and need a fast
   way to add support for content management. Be it sophisticated CMS features like semantic
   content, inline editing, multi-channel delivery etc. or just a few content pages for things
   like the about/contact pages.

#. Developers that need to build a highly customized authoring and content delivery
   solution that no out-of-the-box CMS can properly provide through customization alone.
