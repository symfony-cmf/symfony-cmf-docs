MenuBundle
==========

The CmfMenuBundle extends the `KnpMenuBundle`_ by adding a menu provider
that loads menus from a doctrine object manager and generating menu URLs
from content.

.. caution::

    Make sure you understand how the `KnpMenuBundle`_ works when you want to
    customize the CmfMenuBundle. The CMF menu bundle is just adding
    functionality on top of the Knp menu bundle and this documentation is
    focused on the additional functionality.

.. index:: MenuBundle

Dependencies
------------

This bundle is extending the `KnpMenuBundle`_. Unless you change defaults and
provide your own implementations, this bundle also depends on:

* **CmfRoutingBundle** - if you want to generate routes for content objects.
  Note that you need to explicitly enable the dynamic router as per default it
  is not loaded. See the
  :doc:`documentation of the cmf routing bundle <routing/introduction>` for more information.
* :doc:`PHPCR-ODM <phpcr_odm>` - to load route documents from the content
  repository when using the ``PhpcrMenuProvider``.

Configuration
-------------

If you want to use default configurations, you do not need to change anything.
The values are:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        cmf_menu:
            menu_basepath:        /cms/menu
            document_manager_name: default
            admin_class:          ~
            document_class:       ~
            content_url_generator:  router
            route_name:           ~ # cmf routes are created by content instead of name
            content_basepath:     ~ # defaults to cmf_core.content_basepath
            allow_empty_items:    ~ # defaults to false
            voters:
                uri_prefix:       false # enable the UriPrefixVoter for current menu item
                content_identity: not set # enable the RequestContentIdentityVoter
                    content_key:  not set # override DynamicRouter::CONTENT_KEY
            use_sonata_admin:     auto # use true/false to force using / not using sonata admin
            multilang:            # the whole multilang section is optional
                use_sonata_admin:     auto # use true/false to force using / not using sonata admin
                admin_class:          ~
                document_class:       ~
                locales:              [] # if you use multilang, you have to define at least one locale

If you want to render the menu from twig, make sure you have not disabled twig
in the ``knp_menu`` configuration section.

If you have ``sonata-project/doctrine-phpcr-admin-bundle`` in your
``composer.json`` require section, the menu documents are exposed in the
SonataDoctrinePhpcrAdminBundle. For instructions on how to configure this
Bundle see :doc:`doctrine_phpcr_admin`.

By default, ``use_sonata_admin`` is automatically set based on whether
SonataDoctrinePhpcrAdminBundle is available, but you can explicitly disable it
to not have it even if sonata is enabled, or explicitly enable to get an error
if Sonata becomes unavailable.

By default, menu nodes that have neither the URI nor the routeName field set
and no route can be generated from the linked content are skipped by the
``ContentAwareFactory``. This also leads to their descendants not showing up.
If you want to generate menu items without a link instead, set the
``allow_empty_items`` parameter to true to make the menu items show up as
plain text instead.

Menu Entries
------------

A ``MenuNode`` document defines a menu entry. You can build entries based
on symfony route names, absolute or relative URLs or referenceable PHPCR-ODM
content documents. Route names and URLs are provided directly by `KnpMenu`_.
Generating routes from content objects is a feature of the CmfRoutingBundle.

Menu Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A menu provider is responsible to load a menu when it is requested. KnpMenu
supports having several providers. The CmfMenuBundle provides the
``PhpcrMenuProvider`` to load menu items from PHPCR-ODM.

Every menu has a name and is loaded by that name. The ``PhpcrMenuProvider``
locates menus by looking at ``persistence.phpcr.menu_basepath``/``<menuname>``.
You can use custom document classes for menu nodes if needed, as long as they
implement ``Knp\Menu\NodeInterface`` to integrate with KnpMenuBundle. The
default ``MenuNode`` class discards children that do not implement the
``Knp\Menu\NodeInterface``.

.. note::

    There is currently no support for Doctrine ORM or other persistence
    managers. This is not by design, but only because nobody built that yet.
    We would be glad for a pull request refactoring ``PhpcrMenuProvider`` into
    a base class suitable for all doctrine implementations, and storage
    specific providers.

You can also write your completely custom provider and register it with the
KnpMenu as explained in the `KnpMenuBundle custom provider documentation`_.

Menu Factory
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The menu nodes need to be converted into menu items. This is the job of the
menu factory. A menu item should have a URL associated with it. KnpMenu can
either take the ``uri`` field from the options, or generate a URL from the
``route`` and ``routeParameters`` options. The CmfMenuBundle provides the
``ContentAwareFactory`` that supports to generate the URL from the ``content``
option that contains an object the ``DynamicRouter`` can generate a URL for, plus
eventual ``routeParameters``. Thus a menu node can link to a content object or
a route object in the database and put that object into the options to have the
URL generated.

URL generation is absolute or relative, depending on ``routeAbsolute``.
If you specify the ``linkType`` option, you can control how the URL is
generated. If this parameter is missing, it is determined automatically,
tacking in order ``uri``,``route`` or ``content``.

.. note::

    If you just want to generate normal Symfony routes with a menu that is in
    the database, simply make sure to never provide a ``content`` option and
    either provide the ``route`` and eventual ``routeParameters`` or the
    ``uri``.

Examples::

    <?php

    // get document manager
    $dm = ...;
    $rootNode = $dm->find(null, ...); // retrieve parent menu item

    // using referenceable content document
    $blogContent = $dm->find(null, '/my/cms/content/blog');

    $blogNode = new MenuNode();
    $blogNode->setName('blog');
    $blogNode->setParent($parent);
    $blogNode->setContent($blogDocument);
    $blogNode->setLabel('Blog');

    $dm->persist($blogNode);

    // using a route document
    $timelineRoute = $dm->find(null, '/my/cms/routes/timeline');

    $timelineNode = new MenuNode();
    $timelineNode->setContent($timelineRoute);
    // ...

    $dm->persist($timelineNode);

    // using a symfony route
    $sfRouteNode = new MenuNode();
    $sfRouteNode->setRoute('my_hard_coded_symfony_route');
    // ...

    $dm->persist($sfRouteNode);

    // using URL
    $urlNode = new MenuNode();
    $urlNode->setUri('http://www.example.com');
    // ...

    $dm->persist($urlNode);

    $dm->flush();

The default PHPCR-ODM mapping links content documents by a **weak** reference,
which means you are able to delete the referenced content.

Current Menu Item
-----------------

A menu item can be the current item. If it is the current item, this
information is passed to the twig template which by default adds the css class
``current`` and all menu items that are ancestors of that item get the class
``current_ancestor``. This will typically used in CSS to highlight menu
entries.

The decision about being current item happens by comparing the URI associated
with the menu item with the request URI. Additionally, the CMF menu bundle
supports voters that can look at the ``MenuItem`` and optionally the request.

There are two voter services configured but not enabled by default, another
voter that you can use to configure services and you can write your own voter
classes.

.. note::

    The CMF MenuBundle is based on Knp Menu 1.x. The 2.0 rewrite of Knp Menu
    will add current item voters in the core Knp library.  The CMF bundle
    voters are interface compatible and follow the same mechanism as Knp Menu
    to ease upgrading.

RequestContentIdentityVoter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This voter looks at the ``content`` field of the menu item extras and compares
it with the main content attribute of the request. The name for the main
content attribute in the request is configurable with the ``content_key``
option - if not set it defaults to the constant ``DynamicRouter::CONTENT_KEY``.

You can enable this voter by setting ``cmf_menu.voters.content_identity``
to ``~`` in your config.yml to use a custom ``content_key`` for the main
content attribute name, set it explicitly:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        cmf_menu:
            voters:
                content_identity:
                    content_key: myKey

    .. code-block:: xml

        <container xmlns="http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services">
            <config xmlns="http://cmf.symfony.com/schema/dic/menu">
                <voter>
                    <content-identity>
                        <content-key>myKey</content-key>
                    </content-identity>
                </voter>
            </config>
        </container>

    .. code-block:: php

        $container->loadFromExtension('cmf_menu', array(
            'voters' => array(
                'content_identity' => array(
                    'content_key' => 'myKey',
                ),
            ),
        ));

UriPrefixVoter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The uri prefix voter looks at the ``content`` field of the menu item extras and
checks if it contains an instance of the symfony Route class. If so, it
compares the route option ``currentUriPrefix`` with the request URI. This
allows you to make a whole sub-path of your site trigger the same menu item as
current, but you need to configure the prefix option on your route documents.

To enable the prefix voter, set the configuration key
``cmf_menu.voters.uri_prefix: ~``.

RequestParentContentIdentityVoter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This voter has the same logic of looking for a request attribute to get the
current content, but calls ``getParent`` on it. This parent is compared to the
``content`` of the menu item extras. That way, content that does not have its
own menu entry but a parent that does have a menu item can trigger the right
menu entry to be highlighted.

To use this voter you need to configure a custom service with the name of the
content in the request and your model class to avoid calling getParent on
objects that do not have that method.  You need to tag the service as
``cmf_menu.voter`` and also as ``cmf_request_aware`` because it
depends on the request. The service looks the same as for complete custom
voters (see below), except you do not need to write your own PHP code:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        services:
            my_bundle.menu_voter.parent:
                class: Symfony\Cmf\Bundle\MenuBundle\Voter\RequestParentContentIdentityVoter
                arguments:
                    - contentDocument
                    - %my_bundle.my_model_class%
                tags:
                    - { name: "cmf_menu.voter" }
                    - { name: "cmf_request_aware" }

    .. code-block:: xml

        <service id="my_bundle.menu_voter.parent"
                 class="Symfony\Cmf\Bundle\MenuBundle\Voter\RequestParentContentIdentityVoter">
            <argument>contentDocument</argument>
            <argument>%my_bundle.my_model_class%</argument>
            <tag name="cmf_menu.voter"/>
            <tag name="cmf_request_aware"/>
        </service>

    .. code-block:: php

        $definition = new Definition(
            'Symfony\Cmf\Bundle\MenuBundle\Voter\RequestParentContentIdentityVoter',
            array('contentDocument', '%my_bundle.my_model_class%')
        ));
        $definition->addTag('cmf_menu.voter');
        $definition->addTag('cmf_request_aware');
        $container->setDefinition('my_bundle.menu_voter.parent', $definition);

Custom Voter
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Voters must implement the ``Symfony\Cmf\MenuBundle\Voter\VoterInterface``. To
make the menu bundle notice the voter, tag it with ``cmf_menu.voter``.
If the voter needs the request, add the tag ``cmf_request_aware`` to have a
listener calling ``setRequest`` on the voter before it votes for the first
time.

If you need to know the content the menu item points to, look in the
``content`` field of the menu item extras: ``$item->getExtra('content');``.
The ``ContentAwareFactory`` places the content referenced by the route there -
if it does reference a content. Your voter should handle the case where the
content is null.

For an example service definition see the section above for
``RequestParentIdentityVoter``.

A voter will look something like this::

    <?php
    namespace Acme\MenuBundle\Voter;

    use Symfony\Cmf\Bundle\MenuBundle\Voter\VoterInterface;
    use Knp\Menu\ItemInterface;

    class MyVoter implements VoterInterface
    {
        private $request;

        public function setRequest(Request $request)
        {
            $this->request = $request;
        }

        /**
         * {@inheritDoc}
         */
        public function matchItem(ItemInterface $item)
        {
            if (...) {
                // $item is the current menu item
                return true;
            }
            if (...) {
                // $item for sure is NOT the current menu item
                // even if other voters might match
                return false;
            }

            // we dont know if this is the current item
            return null;
        }
    }

Rendering Menus
---------------

Adjust your twig template to load the menu.

.. code-block:: jinja

    {{ knp_menu_render('simple') }}

The menu name is the name of the node under ``menu_basepath``. For example if
your repository stores the menu nodes under ``/cms/menu`` , rendering "main"
would mean to render the menu that is at ``/cms/menu/main``

Publish Workflow Interface
--------------------------

Menu nodes implement the write interfaces for publishable and publish time
period, see the :ref:`publish workflow documentation <bundle-core-publish_workflow>`
for more information.
