The RoutingAutoBundle
=====================

The ``RoutingAutoBundle`` allows you to define automatically created routes
for documents. This implies a separation of the ``Route`` and ``Content``
documents. If your needs are simple this bundle may not be for you and you 
should have a look at :doc:`SimpleCmsBundle<simple-cms>`.

For the sake of example, we will imagine a  blog application 
that has two routeable contents, the blog itself, and the posts for the blog. 
We will call these documents ``Blog`` and ``Post``, and we will class them as 
*content documents*.

.. note::

    In our example we add an auto route for the blog, but in reality, as a blog
    is something you create rarely, you will probably want to create routes for
    your blog manually, but its up to you.

If we create a new ``Blog`` with the title "My New Blog" the bundle could automatically
create the route ``/blogs/my-new-blog``. For each new ``Post`` it could create a route
such as ``/blogs/my-new-blog/my-posts-title``. This URL resolves to a special type of
route that we will call the *auto route*.

By default, when we update a content document that has an auto route the 
corresponding auto route will also be updated, when deleting a content document 
the corresponding auto route will also be deleted.

If required, the bundle can also be configured to do extra stuff, like, for example,
leaving a ``RedirectRoute`` when the location of a content document changes or
automatically displaying an index page when an unconfigured intermediate path is
accessed (for example, listing all the children under ``/blogs`` instead of returning
a ``404``).

Why not simply use a single route?
----------------------------------

Of course, our fictional blog application could use a single route with a pattern
``/blogs/my-new-blog/{slug}`` which could be handled by a controller. Why not just
do this?

1. By having a route for each page in the system the application has a knowledge of
   which URLs are accessible, this can be very useful, for example, when specifying 
   endpoints for menu items are generating a site map.

2. By separating the route from the content we allow the route to be customized independently
   of the content, for example, a blog post may have the same title as another post but might 
   need a different URL.

3. Separate route documents are translateable - this means we can have a URL for 
   *each language*, "/welcome" and "/bienvenue" would each reference
   the same document in English and French respectively. This would be difficult if
   the slug were embedded in the content document.

4. By decoupling route and content the application doesn't care *what* is referenced in
   the route document. This means that we can easily replace the class of document referenced.

Anatomy of an automatic URL
---------------------------

The diagram below shows a fictional URL for a blog post. The first 6 elements
of the URL are what we will call the *content path*. The last element we will call
the *content name*.

.. image:: ../_images/bundles/routing_auto_post_schema.png

The content path is further broken down into *route stacks* and *routes*. A route
stack is a group of routes and routes are simply documents in the PHPCR tree.

.. note::

    Although routes in this case can be of any document class, only objects which 
    extend the :class:`Symfony\\Component\\Routing\\Route` object will be considered when matching a URL. 

    The default behavior is to use Generic documents when generating a content path, and
    these documents will result in a 404 when accessed directly.

Internally each route stack is built up by a *builder unit*. Builder units contain
one *path provider* class and two actions classes one action to take if the provided
path exists in the PHPCR tree, the other if it does not. The goal
of each builder unit is to generate a path and then provide a route object for each
element in that path.

The configuration for the example above could be as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    symfony_cmf_routing_auto:
        
        auto_route_mapping:
            My\Namespace\Bundle\BlogBundle\Document\Post:
                content_path:
                    # corresponds first route stack in diagram: my, blog, my-blog
                    blog_path:
                        provider:
                            name: content_object
                            method: getBlog
                        exists_action:
                            strategy: use
                        not_exists_action:
                            strategy: throw_exception

                    # corresponds to second route stack: 2013,04,06
                    date:
                        provider:
                            name: content_datetime
                            method: getPublishedDate
                        exists_action:
                            strategy: use
                        not_exists_action:
                            strategy: create

                # corresponds to the content name: My Post Title
                content_name:
                    provider:
                        name: content_method
                        method: getTitle
                    exists_action: 
                        strategy: auto_increment
                        pattern: -%d
                    not_exists_action: 
                        strategy: create


The ``Post`` document would then need to implement the methods named above as follows::

    <?php
    
    class Post
    {
        public function getBlog()
        {
            // return the blog object associated with the post
            return $this->blog;
        }

        public function getPublishedDate()
        {
            return new \DateTime('2013/04/06');
        }

        public function getTitle()
        {
            return "My post title";
        }
    }

Path Providers
--------------

Path providers specify a target path which is used by the subsequent path actions to provide
the actual route documents.

**Base** providers must be the first configured as the first builder in the content path chain.
This is because the paths that they provide correspond directly to an existing path, i.e. they
have an absolute reference.

specified (base provider)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the most basic path provider and allows you to specify an exact (fixed) path.

.. code-block:: yaml

    path_provider:
        name: specified
        path: this/is/a/path

Options:

 - ``path`` - **required** The path to provide. 

.. note::
   
    We never specifiy absolute paths in the auto route system. If the builder unit 
    is the first content path chain it is understood that it is the base of an absolute 
    path.

content_object (base provider)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The content object provider will try and provide a path from an object implementing 
``RouteAwareInterface`` provided by a designated method on the content document. For 
example, if you have a ``Post`` class, which has a ``getBlog`` method, using
this provider you can tell the ``Post`` auto route to use the route of the blog as a 
base.

So basically, if your blog content has a path of ``/this/is/my/blog`` you can use this 
path as the base of your ``Post`` auto-route.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    provider:
        name: content_object
        method: getBlog

.. note::

    At the time of writing translated objects are not supported. This isn't hard to do, but well, I just
    havn't done it yet.

Options:

 - ``method``: **required** Method used to return the document whose route path we wish to use.

content_method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``content_method`` provider allows the content object (e.g. a blog ``Post``) to specify
a path using one of its methods. This is quite a powerful method as it allows the content 
document to do whatever it can to produce the route, the disadvantage is that your content
document will have extra code in it.

Example 1:

.. code-block:: yaml

    path_provider:
        name: content_method
        method: getTitle

This example will use the existing method "getTitle" of the ``Post`` document to retrieve the 
title. By default all strings are *slugified*.

The method can return the path either as a single string or an array of path elements
as shown in the following example::

    <?php

    class Post
    {
         public function getTitle()
         {
            return "This is a post";
         }

         public function getPathElements()
         {
            return array('this', 'is', 'a', 'path');
         }
    }

Options:

 - ``method``: **required** Method used to return the route name / path / path elements.
 - ``slugify``: If we should use the slugifier, default is ``true``.

content_datetime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``content_datettime`` provider will provide a path from a ``DateTime`` object provided by a designated
method on the content document.

Example 1:

.. code-block:: yaml

    provider:
        name: content_datetime
        method: getDate

Example 2:

.. code-block:: yaml

    provider:
        name: content_datetime
        method: getDate
        date_format: Y/m/d

.. note::

    This method extends `content_method` and inherits the slugify feature. Internally we return a string using
    the `DateTime->format()` method. This means that you can specify your date in anyway you like and it will be
    automatically slugified, also, by adding path separators in the `date_format` you are effectively creating
    routes for each date component as slugify applies to **each element** of the path.

Options:

 - ``method``: **required** Method used to return the route name / path / path elements.
 - ``slugify``: If we should use the slugifier, default is ``true``.
 - ``date_format``: Any date format accepted by the `DateTime` class, default ``Y-m-d``.

Path Exists Actions
-------------------

These are the default actions available to take if the path provided by a `path_provider` already exists and
so creating a new path would create a conflict.

auto_increment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``auto_increment`` action will add a numerical suffix to the path, for example ``my/path`` would first become
``my/path-1`` and if that path *also* exists it will try ``my/path-2``, ``my/path-3`` and so on into infinity until
it finds a path which *doesn't* exist.

This action should typically be used in the ``content_name`` builder unit to resolve conflicts. Using it in the
``content_path`` builder chain would not make much sense (I can't imagine any use cases at the moment).

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    exists_action:
        name: auto_increment

Options:

 - None.

use
~~~

The ``use`` action will simply take the existing path and use it. For example, in our post example the first 
builder unit must first determine the blogs path, ``/my/blog``, if this path exists (and it should) then we 
will *use* it in the stack.

This action should typically be used in one of the content path builder units to specify that we should use
the existing route, on the other hand, using this as the content name builder action should cause the old 
route to be overwritten.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    exists_action:
        name: use

Options:

 - None.

Path not exists actions
-----------------------

These are the default actions available to take if the path provided by a ``path_provider`` does not exist.

create
~~~~~~

The ``create`` action will create the path. **currently** all routes provided by the content path build units
will be created as ``Generic`` documents, whilst the content name route will be created as an ``AutoRoute`` document.

.. code-block:: yaml

    not_exists_action:
        name: create

Options:

 - None.

throw_exception
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This action will throw an exception if the route provided by the path provider does not exist. You should take
this action if you are sure that the route *should* exist.

.. code-block:: yaml

    not_exists_action:
        name: create

Options:

 - None.

Customization
-------------

.. _routingauto_customization_pathproviders:

Adding Path Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goal of a ``PathProvider`` class is to add one or several path elements to
the route stack. For example, the following provider will add the path "foo/bar"
to the route stack::

    <?php

    use Symfony\Cmf\Bundle\RoutingAutoBundle\AutoRoute\PathProviderInterface;
    use Symfony\Cmf\Bundle\RoutingAutoBundle\AutoRoute\RouteStack;

    class FoobarProvider implements PathProviderInterface
    {
        public function providePath(RouteStack $routeStack)
        {
            $routeStack->addPathElements(array('foo', 'bar'));
        }
    }

To use the path provider you must register it in the **DIC** and add the 
``symfony_cmf_routing_auto.provider`` tag and set the **alias** accordingly.

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: xml

        <service 
            id="my_cms.some_bundle.path_provider.foobar" 
            class="FoobarProvider"
            scope="prototype"
        >
            <tag name="symfony_cmf_routing_auto.provider" alias="foobar"/>
        </service>

    .. code-block:: yaml

        my_cms.some_bundle.path_provider.foobar:
            class: "FoobarProvider"
            scope: prototype
            tags:
                - { name: symfony_cmf_routing_auto.provider, alias: "foobar"}

    .. code-block:: php
    
        $definition = new Definition('FooBarProvider');
        $definition->addTag('symfony_cmf_routing_auto.provider', array('alias' => 'foobar'));
        $definition->setScope('prototype');
        $container->setDefinition('my_cms.some_bundle.path_provider.foobar', $definition);

The **foobar** path provider is now available as **foobar**.

.. note::

    The that both path providers and path actions need to be defined with a 
    scope of "prototype". This ensures that each time the auto routing system
    requests the class a new one is given and we do not have any state problems.

Adding Path Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the auto routing system, a "path action" is an action to take if the path provided
by the "path provider" exists or not.

You can add a path action by extending the ``PathActionInterface`` and registering your
new class correctly in the DI configuration.

This is a very simple implementation from the bundle - it is used to throw an exception 
when a path already exists::

    <?php

    namespace Symfony\Cmf\Bundle\RoutingAutoBundle\AutoRoute\PathNotExists;

    use Symfony\Cmf\Bundle\RoutingAutoBundle\AutoRoute\PathActionInterface;
    use Symfony\Cmf\Bundle\RoutingAutoBundle\AutoRoute\Exception\CouldNotFindRouteException;
    use Symfony\Cmf\Bundle\RoutingAutoBundle\AutoRoute\RouteStack;

    class ThrowException implements PathActionInterface
    {
        public function init(array $options)
        {
        }

        public function execute(RouteStack $routeStack)
        {
            throw new CouldNotFindRouteException('/'.$routeStack->getFullPath());
        }
    }

It is registered in the DI configuration as follows:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: xml

        <service 
            id="my_cms.not_exists_action.throw_exception" 
            class="My\Cms\AutoRoute\PathNotExists\ThrowException"
            scope="prototype"
            >
            <tag name="symfony_cmf_routing_auto.not_exists_action" alias="throw_exception"/>
        </service>

    .. code-block:: yaml

        symfony_cmf_routing_auto.not_exists_action.throw_exception
            class: "My\Cms\AutoRoute\PathNotExists\ThrowException"
            scope: prototype
            tags:
                - { name: symfony_cmf_routing_auto.provider, alias: "throw_exception"}

    .. code-block:: php
    
        $definition = new Definition('My\Cms\AutoRoute\PathNotExists\ThrowException');
        $definition->addTag('symfony_cmf_routing_auto.provider', array('alias' => 'throw_exception'));
        $definition->setScope('prototype');
        $container->setDefinition('my_cms.some_bundle.path_provider.throw_exception', $definition);

Note the following:

* **Scope**: Must *always* be set to *prototype*;
* **Tag**: The tag registers the service with the auto routing system, it can be one of the following;
    * ``symfony_cmf_routing_auto.exists.action`` - if the action is to be used when a path exists;
    * ``symfony_cmf_routing_auto.not_exists.action`` - if the action is to be used when a path does not exist;
* **Alias**: The alias of the tag is the name by which you will reference this action in the auto routing schema.
