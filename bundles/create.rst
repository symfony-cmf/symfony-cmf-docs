The CreateBundle
================

The `CreateBundle <https://github.com/symfony-cmf/CreateBundle>`_
integrates create.js and the createphp helper library into Symfony2.

Create.js is a comprehensive web editing interface for Content Management
Systems. It is designed to provide a modern, fully browser-based HTML5
environment for managing content. Create can be adapted to work on almost any
content management backend. The default editor is the Hallo Editor, but you can
also use CKEditor
See http://createjs.org/


Createphp is a PHP library to help with RDFa annotating your documents/entities.
See https://github.com/flack/createphp for documentation on how it works.

.. index:: CreateBundle

Dependencies
------------

This bundle includes create.js (which bundles all its dependencies like jquery,
vie, hallo, backbone etc) as a git submodule. Do not forget to add the composer
script handler to your composer.json as described below.

PHP dependencies are managed through composer. We use createphp as well as
AsseticBundle, FOSRestBundle and by inference also JmsSerializerBundle. Make
sure you instantiate all those bundles in your kernel and properly configure
assetic.

Installation
------------

This bundle is best included using Composer.

Edit your project composer file to add a new require for symfony-cmf/create-bundle.
Then create a scripts section or add to the existing one:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "scripts": {
            "post-install-cmd": [
                "Symfony\\Cmf\\Bundle\\CreateBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::downloadCreate",
                ...
            ],
            "post-update-cmd": [
                "Symfony\\Cmf\\Bundle\\CreateBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::downloadCreate",
                ...
            ]
        }
    }

It is possible to specify another directory, repository or commit id in the extra
parameters of ``composer.json`` file (here are the default values):

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "extra": {
            "create-directory": "vendor/symfony-cmf/create-bundle/Symfony/Cmf/Bundle/CreateBundle/Resources/public/vendor/create",
            "create-repository": "https://github.com/bergie/create.git",
            "create-commit": "271e0114a039ab256ffcceacdf7f361803995e05"
        }
    }


Add this bundle (and its dependencies, if they are not already there) to your
application's kernel:

.. code-block:: php

    // application/ApplicationKernel.php
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        return array(
            // ...
            new Symfony\Bundle\AsseticBundle\AsseticBundle(),
            new JMS\SerializerBundle\JMSSerializerBundle($this),
            new FOS\RestBundle\FOSRestBundle(),
            new Symfony\Cmf\Bundle\CreateBundle\SymfonyCmfCreateBundle(),
            // ...
        );
    }

You also need to configure FOSRestBundle to handle json:


.. code-block:: yaml

    fos_rest:
        view:
            formats:
                json: true

.. _bundle-create-ckeditor:

Using CKEditor instead
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use CKEditor, edit the ``composer.json`` file to call
``downloadCreateAndCkeditor`` instead of ``downloadCreate``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "scripts": {
            "post-install-cmd": [
                "Symfony\\Cmf\\Bundle\\CreateBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::downloadCreateAndCkeditor",
                ...
            ],
            "post-update-cmd": [
                "Symfony\\Cmf\\Bundle\\CreateBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::downloadCreateAndCkeditor",
                ...
            ]
        }
    }

and re-run composer:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php composer.phar update nothing

In your application config file, define the editor base path:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        symfony_cmf_create:
            editor_base_path: /bundles/symfonycmfcreate/vendor/ckeditor/

    .. code-block:: xml

        <cmf-create
            editor-base-path="/bundles/symfonycmfcreate/vendor/ckeditor/"
        />

    .. code-block:: php

        $container->loadFromExtension('symfony_cmf_create', array(
            'editor_base_path': '/bundles/symfonycmfcreate/vendor/ckeditor/',
        ));

In your template, load the javascript files using:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% render controller(
        "symfony_cmf_create.jsloader.controller:includeJSFilesAction",
        {"editor": "ckeditor"}
    %}

As for create.js, you can override the source of CKEditor to a different
target directory, source repository or commit id in the extra
parameters of the ``composer.json`` file (here are the default values):

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "extra": {
            "ckeditor-directory": "vendor/symfony-cmf/create-bundle/Symfony/Cmf/Bundle/CreateBundle/Resources/public/vendor/ckeditor",
            "ckeditor-repository": "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-releases.git",
            "ckeditor-commit": "bba29309f93a1ace1e2e3a3bd086025975abbad0"
        }
    }

Concept
-------

Createphp uses RDFa metadata about your domain classes, much like doctrine
knows the metadata how an object is stored in the database. The metadata is
modelled by the type class and can come from any source. Createphp provides
metadata drivers that read XML, php arrays and one that just introspects
objects and creates non-semantical metadata that will be enough for create.js
to edit.

The RdfMapper is used to translate between your storage layer and createphp.
It is passed the domain object and the relevant metadata object.

With the metadata and the twig helper, the content is rendered with RDFa
annotations. create.js is loaded and enables editing on the entities. Save
operations happen in ajax calls to the backend.

The REST controller handles those ajax calls, and if you want to be able
to upload images, an image controller saves uploaded images and tells the
image location.


Configuration
-------------

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config.yml
        symfony_cmf_create:
            # metadata loading

            # directory list to look for metadata
            rdf_config_dirs:
                - "%kernel.root_dir%/Resources/rdf-mappings"
            # look for mappings in <Bundle>/Resources/rdf-mappings
            # auto_mapping: true

            # use a different class for the REST handler
            # rest_controller_class: FQN\Classname

            # image handling
            image:
                model_class: ~
                controller_class: ~

            # access check role for js inclusion, default REST and image controllers
            # role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY

            # enable the doctrine PHPCR-ODM mapper
            phpcr_odm: true

            # mapping from rdf type name => class name used when adding items to collections
            map:
                rdfname: FQN\Classname

            # stanbol url for semantic enhancement, otherwise defaults to the demo install
            # stanbol_url: http://dev.iks-project.eu:8081

            # fix the Hallo editor toolbar on top of the page
            # fixed_toolbar: true

            # RDFa types used for elements to be edited in plain text
            # plain_text_types: ['dcterms:title']

            # RDFa types for which to create the corresponding routes after
            # content of these types has been added with Create.js. This is
            # not necessary with the SimpleCmsBundle, as the content and the
            # routes are in the same repository tree.
            # create_routes_types: ['http://schema.org/NewsArticle']

The provided javascript file configures create.js and the hallo editor. It
enables some plugins like the tag editor to edit ``skos:related`` collections of
attributes. We hope to add some configuration options to tweak the
configuration of create.js but you can also use the file as a template and do
your own if you need larger customizations.


Metadata
~~~~~~~~

createphp needs metadata information for each class of your domain model. By
default, the create bundle uses the XML metadata driver and looks for metadata
in the enabled bundles at <Bundle>/Resources/rdf-mappings. If you use a bundle
that has no RDFa mapping, you can specify a list of rdf_config_dirs that will
additionally be checked for metadata.

See the `documentation of createphp <https://github.com/flack/createphp>`_ for the format of the XML metadata format.


Access control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use the default REST controller, everybody can edit content once you
enabled the create bundle. To restrict access, specify a role other than the
default IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY to the bundle.
If you specify a different role, create.js will only be loaded if the user has that role
and the REST handler (and image handler if enabled) will check the role.

If you need more fine grained access control, look into the mapper ``isEditable`` method.
You can extend the mapper you use and overwrite isEditable to answer whether the
passed domain object is editable.


Image Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable the default simplistic image handler with the image > model_class | controller_class
settings. This image handler just throws images into the PHPCR-ODM repository
and also serves them in requests.

If you need different image handling, you can either overwrite
image.model_class and/or image.controller_class, or implement a custom
ImageController and override the ``symfony_cmf_create.image.controller``
service with it.


Mapping requests to objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For now, the bundle only provides a service to map to doctrine PHPCR-ODM. Enable it
by setting `phpcr_odm` to true. If you need something else, you need to provide a
service `symfony_cmf_create.object_mapper`. (If you need a wrapper for doctrine ORM,
look at the mappers in the createphp library and do a pull request on that library,
and another one to expose the ORM mapper as service in the create bundle).

Also note that createphp would support different mappers for different RDFa types.
If you need that, dig into the createphp and create bundle and do a pull request to
enable this feature.

To be able to create new objects, you need to provide a map between the RDFa types
and the class names. (TODO: can we not index all mappings and do this automatically?)


Routing
~~~~~~~

Finally add the relevant routing to your configuration

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        create:
            resource: "@SymfonyCmfCreateBundle/Resources/config/routing/rest.xml"
        create_image:
            resource: "@SymfonyCmfCreateBundle/Resources/config/routing/image.xml"

    .. code-block:: xml

        <import resource="@SymfonyCmfCreateBundle/Resources/config/routing/rest.xml" type="rest" />
        <import resource="@SymfonyCmfCreateBundle/Resources/config/routing/image.xml" type="rest" />

.. _bundle-create-usage-embed:

Usage
-----

Adjust your template to load the editor js files if the current session is allowed to edit content.

If you are using Symfony 2.2 or higher:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% render controller("symfony_cmf_create.jsloader.controller:includeJSFilesAction", {'_locale': app.request.locale}) %}

For versions prior to 2.2, this will do:

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% render "symfony_cmf_create.jsloader.controller:includeJSFilesAction" with {'_locale': app.request.locale} %}

Plus make sure that assetic is rewriting paths in your css files, then  include
the base css files (and customize with your css as needed) with

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% include "SymfonyCmfCreateBundle::includecssfiles.html.twig" %}

The other thing you have to do is provide RDFa mappings for your model classes
and adjust your templates to render with createphp so that create.js knows what
content is editable.

Create XML metadata mappings in <Bundle>/Resources/rdf-mappings or a path you
configured in rdf_config_dirs named after the full classname of your model
classes with ``\\`` replaced by a dot (``.``), i.e.
Symfony.Cmf.Bundle.SimpleCmsBundle.Document.MultilangPage.xml.
For an example mapping see the files in the cmf-sandbox. Reference documentation is in the
`createphp library repository <https://github.com/flack/createphp>`_.

To render your model, use the createphp twig tag:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {% createphp page as="rdf" %}
    {{ rdf|raw }}
    {% endcreatephp %}

Or if you need more control over the generated HTML:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    {% createphp page as="rdf" %}
    <div {{ createphp_attributes(rdf) }}>
        <h1 class="my-title" {{ createphp_attributes( rdf.title ) }}>{{ createphp_content( rdf.title ) }}</h1>
        <div {{ createphp_attributes( rdf.body ) }}>{{ createphp_content( rdf.body ) }}</div>
    </div>
    {% endcreatephp %}


Alternative Editors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can write your own templates to load a javascript editor. They have to
follow the naming pattern ``SymfonyCmfCreateBundle::includejsfiles-%editor%.html.twig``
to be loaded. In the includeJSFilesAction, you specify the editor parameter.
(Do not forget to add the ``controller`` call around the controller name inside
``render`` for Symfony 2.2, as in the example above.)

    {% render "symfony_cmf_create.jsloader.controller:includeJSFilesAction" with {'editor': 'aloha', '_locale': app.request.locale } %}

.. note::

    Create.js has built in support for Aloha and ckeditor, as well as the
    default hallo editor. Those should be supported by the CreateBundle as well.
    See these github issue for `ckeditor <https://github.com/symfony-cmf/CreateBundle/issues/33>`_
    and `alhoa <https://github.com/symfony-cmf/CreateBundle/issues/32>`_ integration.

    If you wrote the necessary code for one of those editors, or another editor
    that could be useful for others, please send a pull request.


Developing the hallo wysiwyg editor
-----------------------------------

You can develop the hallo editor inside the Create bundle. By default, a minimized
version of hallo that is bundled with create is used. To develop the actual code,
you will need to checkout the full hallo repository first. You can do this by running
the following command from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    app/console cmf:create:init-hallo-devel


There is a special template to load the coffee script files. To load this,
just use the ``hallo-coffee`` editor with the includeJSFilesAction.
(Do not forget to add the ``controller`` call around the controller name inside
``render`` for Symfony 2.2, as in the example above.)

.. code-block:: jinja

    {% render "symfony_cmf_create.jsloader.controller:includeJSFilesAction" with {'editor': 'hallo-coffee', '_locale': app.request.locale } %}


The hallo-coffee template uses assetic to load the coffee script files from
``Resources/public/vendor/hallo/src``, rather than the precompiled javascript
from ``Resources/public/vendor/create/deps/hallo-min.js``. This also means that
you need to add a mapping for coffeescript in your assetic configuration and
you need the `coffee compiler set up correctly <http://coffeescript.org/#installation>`_.

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        assetic:
            filters:
                cssrewrite: ~
                coffee:
                    bin: %coffee.bin%
                    node: %coffee.node%
                    apply_to: %coffee.extension%

In the cmf sandbox we did a little hack to not alwas trigger coffee script compiling.
In config.yml we make the coffee extension configurable. Now if the
parameters.yml sets ``coffee.extension`` to ``\.coffee`` the coffeescript is
compiled and the coffee compiler needs to be installed. If you set it to
anything else like ``\.nocoffee`` then you do not need the coffee compiler
installed.

The default values for the three parameters are

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        coffee.bin: /usr/local/bin/coffee
        coffee.node: /usr/local/bin/node
        coffee.extension: \.coffee
