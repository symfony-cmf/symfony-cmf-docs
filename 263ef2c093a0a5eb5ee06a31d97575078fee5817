I would prefer it to be `xml` to be honest, as that is the first example we show when showing examples in all formats.

the first `.. configuration-block::` i see starts with yml first, so that is what is shown. but i have no strong opinion here, we can go with explicit xml format too. (this will make it visible to the users how they could achieve yml if they prefer that)

Oh yeah. You are right, guess I must be subconsciously clicking XML without noticing :P in that case `yml` is fine as a default for me.

Annotations would use `@Template`, `@Route` and services in XML.

As the best practice is using that, I'm leaning a bit towards using it aswell. On the other hand, I'll do a walkthrough to be consistent with the best practices after Sf2.6 is released.

This should be merged into 1.1, I believe?

(we should create a plan about when to deprecate versions)
