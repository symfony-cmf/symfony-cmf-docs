    single: Storage Layer

Choosing a Storage Layer
========================

When building a CMS, the choice of storage layer is one of the key decisions
to take. Many factors must be considered, the good news is that with all the
components and Bundles in the CMF, it takes extra care to provide the
necessary extension points to ensure the **CMF remains storage layer
agnostic**.

The goal of this tutorial is to explain the considerations and why Symfony CMF
suggest `PHPCR`_ and `PHPCR-ODM`_ as the ideal basis for a CMS. However, all
components and Bundles can be integrated with other solutions with a fairly
small amount of work.

Requirements for a CMS Storage Layer
------------------------------------

At the most fundamental level a CMS is about storing, so the first requirement
is that *a CMS must provide means to store content with different properties*.

A CMS has very different storage needs than for example a system for
processing orders.  Do note however that it is entirely possible and very
intended of the CMF initiative to enable developers to combine the CMF with a
system for processing orders. So for example one could create a shopping
solution using the CMF for storing the product catalog, while using another
system for maintaining the inventory, customer data and orders. This leads to
the second requirement, *a CMS must provide means to reference content*, both
content stored inside the CMS, but also in other systems.

The actual content in a CMS tends to be organized in a tree like structure,
mimicking a file system. Note that content authors might want to use different
structures for how to organize the content and how to organize other aspects
like the menu and the routing.  This leads to the third requirement, *a CMS
must provide means to represent the content as a tree structure*.  Furthermore
a fourth requirement is that *a CMS should allow maintaining several
independent tree structures*.

In general data inside a CMS tends to be unstructured. So while several pages
inside the CMS might be very similar, there is a good chance that there will
be many permutations needing different extra fields, therefore *a CMS must not
enforce a singular schema for content*.  That being said, in order to better
maintain the content structure and enabling UI layers from generically
displaying content elements it is important to optionally be able to express
rules that must be followed and that can also help attach additional semantic
meaning. So *a CMS must provide means to optionally define a schema for
content elements*.

This requirement actually also relates to another need, in that a CMS must
make it easy for content authors to prepare a series of changes in a staging
environment that then needs to go online in a single step. This means another
requirement is that it is necessary that *a CMS should support moving and
exporting content between independent tree structures*.  Note that exporting
can be useful also for backups.

When making changes it would however also be useful to be able to version the
change sets, so that they remain available for historical purposes, but also
to be able to revert whenever needed. Therefore the next requirement is that
*a CMS should provide the ability to version content*.

As we live in a globalized world, websites need to provide content in multiple
languages addressing different regions. However not all pieces of content need
to be translated and others might only be eventually translated but until then
the user should be presented the content in one of the available languages, so
*a CMS should provide the ability to store content in different languages,
with optional fallback rules*.

As a CMS usually tends to store an increasing amount of content it will become
necessary to provide some way for users to search the content even when the
user has only a very fuzzy idea about the content they are looking for,
leading to the requirement that *a CMS must provide full text search
capabilities*, ideally leveraging both the contents tree structure and the
data schema.

Another popular need is limiting read and/or write access of content to
specific users or groups. Ideally this solution would also integrate with the
tree structure. So it would be useful if *a CMS provides capabilities to
define access controls* that leverage the tree structure to quickly manage
access for entire subtrees.

Finally not all steps in the content authoring process will be done by the
same person.  As a matter of fact there might be multiple steps all of which
might not even be done by a person. Instead some of the steps might even be
executed by a machine. So for example a photographer might upload a new image,
a content author might attach the photo to some text, then the system
automatically generates thumbnails and web optimized renditions and finally an
editor decides on the final publication. Therefore *a CMS should provide
capabilities to assist in the management of workflows*.

Summary
-------

Here is a summary of the above requirements. Note some of the requirements
have a *must*, while others only have a *should*. Obviously depending on your
use case you might prioritize features differently:

* a CMS must provide means to store content with different properties;
* a CMS must provide means to reference content;
* a CMS must provide means to represent the content as a tree structure;
* a CMS must provide full text search capabilities;
* a CMS must not enforce a singular schema for content;
* a CMS must provide means to optionally define a schema for content elements;
* a CMS should allow maintaining several independent tree structures;
* a CMS should support moving and exporting content between independent tree structures;
* a CMS should provide the ability to version content;
* a CMS should provide the ability to store content in different languages, with optional fallback rules;
* a CMS should provides capabilities to define access controls;
* a CMS should provide capabilities to assist in the management of workflows.

RDBMS
-----

Looking at the above requirements it becomes apparent that out the box an
RDBMS is ill-suited to address the needs of a CMS. RDBMS were never intended
to store tree structures of unstructured content. Really the only requirement
RDBMS cover from the above list is the ability to store content, some way to
reference content, keep multiple separate content structures and a basic level
of access controls and triggers.

This is not a failing of RDBMS in the sense that they were simply designed for
a different use case: the ability to store, manipulate and aggregate
structured data. This makes them ideal for storing inventory and orders.

That is not to say that it is impossible to build a system on top of an RDBMS
that addresses more or even all of the above topics. Some RDBMS natively
support recursive queries, which can be useful for retrieving tree structures.
Even if such native support is missing, there are algorithms like materialized
path and nested sets that can enable efficient storage and retrieval of tree
structures for different use cases.

The point is however that these all require algorithms and code on top of an
RDBMS which also tightly bind your business logic to a particular RDBMS and/or
algorithm even if some of them can be abstracted. So again using an ORM one
could create a pluggable system for managing tree structures with different
algorithms which prevent binding the business logic of the CMS to a particular
algorithm.

However it should be said once more, that all Bundles and Components in the
CMF are developed to enable any persistent storage API and we welcome
contributions for adding implementations for other storage systems. So for
example CMF RoutingBundle currently only provides Document classes for PHPCR
ODM, but the interfaces defined in the Routing component are storage agnostic
and we would accept a contribution to add Doctrine ORM support.

PHPCR
-----

`PHPCR`_ essentially is a set of interfaces addressing most of the
requirements from the above list.  This means that PHPCR is totally storage
agnostic in the sense that it is possible to really put any persistence
solution behind PHPCR.  So in the same way as an ORM can support different
tree storage algorithms via some plugin, PHPCR aims to provide an API for the
entire breath of CMS needs, therefore cleanly separating the entire business
logic of your CMS from the persistence choice. As a matter of fact the only
feature above not natively supported by PHPCR is support for translations.

Thanks to the availability of several PHPCR implementations supporting various
kinds of persistence choices, creating a CMS on top of PHPCR means that end
users are enabled to pick and choose what works best for them, their available
resources, their expertise and their scalability requirements.

So for the simplest use cases there is for example a Doctrine DBAL based
solution provided by the `Jackalope`_ PHPCR implementation that can use the
SQLite RDBMS shipped with PHP itself. At the other end of the spectrum
Jackalope also supports `Jackrabbit`_ which supports clustering and can
efficiently handle data into the hundreds of gigabytes. By default Jackrabbit
simply uses the file system for persistence, but it can also use an RDBMS.
However future versions will support MongoDB and support for other NoSQL
solutions like CouchDB or Cassandra is entirely possible. Again, switching the
persistence solution would require no code changes as the business logic is
only bound to the PHPCR interfaces.

Please see :doc:`choosing_phpcr_implementation` for more details
on the available PHPCR implementations and their requirements and
:doc:`../../bundles/phpcr_odm/introduction` for how to configure a repository
in Symfony.

PHPCR ODM
---------

As mentioned above using PHPCR does not mean giving up on RDBMS. In many ways,
PHPCR can be considered a specialized ORM solution for CMS. However while
PHPCR works with so called *nodes*, in an ORM people expect to be able to map
class instances to a persistence layer. This is exactly what PHPCR ODM
provides. It follows the same interface classes as Doctrine ORM while also
exposing all the additional capabilities of PHPCR, like trees and versioning.
Furthermore, it also provides native support for translations, covering the
only omission of PHPCR for the above mentioned requirements list of a CMS
storage solution.
